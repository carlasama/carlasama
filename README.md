I've amassed several months of practical experience with Angular and TypeScript, but my current role primarily involves working with Vue.js, alongside Laravel, to seamlessly connect front-end and back-end systems.

Additionally, I'm deeply engaged in a personal project where I'm actively exploring Express.js and MongoDB. This endeavor allows me to further my understanding of server-side development and data modeling.
