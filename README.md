**Stack**: Vue.js, Vuex, Tailwind CSS and JavaScript.

I've accumulated several months of hands-on experience with Angular and TypeScript, but my current preference is Vue.js; it has become my framework of choice!

In my professional work, I'm dedicated to harnessing the power of Laravel to seamlessly connect frontend and backend systems.

Moreover, I'm deeply engrossed in a personal project, where I'm actively exploring **Express.js** and **MongoDB**. This endeavor allows me to delve into the intricacies of server-side development and data modeling, honing my skills in creating efficient and robust solutions.
